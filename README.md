# AP-Comsci-java-game
A game made in Java as a side project for my AP computer science class
##What is it?
This is a small terminal, rougelike dungeon crawler.
Your goal is to kill enemies and buy upgrades at shops, eventually making your way through the floors of the dungeon to kill the final boss
All of the controlls have prompts onscreen, so playing should be self explanatory.
